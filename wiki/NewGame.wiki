If you're making a new game using Spearmint, these are some suggested changes you may want to make.

== Engine ==
If you're game isn't going to be a mod (only changing game, cgame, and ui), you should probably rebrand the engine.

Open code/qcommon/q_shared.h

Near the top of the file is the following:
<code language="c">
  #define PRODUCT_NAME			"Spearmint"
  #define BASEGAME			"baseq3"
  #define CLIENT_WINDOW_TITLE     	"Spearmint"
  #define CLIENT_WINDOW_MIN_TITLE 	"Spearmint"
  #define HOMEPATH_NAME_UNIX		".spearmint"
  #define HOMEPATH_NAME_WIN		"Spearmint"
  #define HOMEPATH_NAME_MACOSX		HOMEPATH_NAME_WIN
  #define GAMENAME_FOR_MASTER		"Spearmint"	// must NOT contain whitespace

  #ifndef PRODUCT_VERSION
    #define PRODUCT_VERSION "1.36"
  #endif
</code>

BASEGAME is the default loaded mod.

Changing GAMENAME_FOR_MASTER will make sure your game is separated from other games in the server browser.

PRODUCT_VERSION here is only used by Code::Blocks and MSVC projects. You should keep it in sync with PRODUCT_VERSION in Makefile.

== Cgame ==
You may want to add new CTF/1FCTF/Overload sounds for splitscreen, see NewSounds page.
